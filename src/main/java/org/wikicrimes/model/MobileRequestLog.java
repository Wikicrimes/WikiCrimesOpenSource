/**
 
    WikiCrimes (http://www.wikicrimes.org) is a project/software that allows posting and accessing criminal occurrences in a digital map.
    The philosophy that drives Wikicrimes is the same as Wikipedia: mass collaboration produces valuable knowledge.
    That is to say, if everybody participates, the criminal mapping will be made collaboratively and everybody
    will leverage crime information digitalized in the map. That is the reason for the slogan "Share crime information. Keep safe!". 
    Wikicrimes is not a project developed by any security institution. 
    In fact it is a project from the citizen to the citizen.
